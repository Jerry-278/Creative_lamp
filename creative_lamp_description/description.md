# Personal project: Creative lamp

## 个人项目：创意灯具

依据脑中所想，我在 3D 软件里逐步尝试落实我的想法。
Based on what I had in mind, I gradually tried to implement my ideas in 3D software.

首先我为灯具设计了一个简介的外观：一个四边等宽除了底面以外的其他面和中间挖空的立方体。
First, I designed a brief appearance for the lamp: a cube with four sides of equal width and a hollowed-out middle except for the bottom.

这样我们已经初步确定了灯具的结构：
一个能容纳电池盒的底面（他的高应该和边框的宽相等）
一个确保了灯具外观的正方形框架（能够与电池盒连接）
和一个能让 LED 灯光透出的罩子（必须是浅色的，并且能够嵌入框架）
So we have preliminarily determined the structure of the lamp:
A bottom surface that can accommodate the battery box (its height should be equal to the width of the frame)
A square frame that ensures the appearance of the lamp (can be connected to the battery box)
And a cover that allows the LED light to shine through (must be light-colored and can be embedded in the frame)

结合上次制作模型小车的经验，我首先想要确定的就是灯具的尺寸。
Combined with the experience of making a model car last time, the first thing I want to determine is the size of the lamp.

在测量完电池盒的大小之后，我设计了第一个底面，其恰好可以容纳电池盒的尺寸，节省材料的同时也预留出了可控制开关的孔洞。但我低估了电池盒的大小，在放置他的同时预留的空间不够让透光的罩子盖住整个灯具。
After measuring the size of the battery box, I designed the first bottom surface, which just accommodates the size of the battery box, saving materials and also reserving a hole for the control switch. But I underestimated the size of the battery box, and the space reserved for placing it was not enough for the light-transmitting cover to cover the entire lamp.

所以我立刻对其进行改良，并设计出了第二个电池盒，解决了以上问题。
So I immediately improved it and designed a second battery box to solve the above problems.

框架也根据电池盒的尺寸改变。
The frame also changes according to the size of the battery box.

所幸透光罩子可以直接在打印机软件里搞定，省下我很多功夫。
Fortunately, the light-transmitting cover can be made directly in the printer software, which saves me a lot of effort.

在相继打印完所有部件后，我非常高兴的发现尺寸相当准确，没有出现任何问题。
After printing all the parts one after another, I was very happy to find that the size was quite accurate and there were no problems.

区别与上次，这次的组装过程中除了打印件还有电灯的电路。
非常简单，将 LED 的正负极与电池的连接好就可以了。我还用铁丝和贴纸固定了 LED 和电线的位置。
Unlike last time, this time, in addition to the printed parts, there was also the circuit of the light in the assembly process.
It was very simple. Just connect the positive and negative poles of the LED to the battery. I also used iron wire and stickers to fix the position of the LED and wires.

这样一个创意灯具就完成了，我知道这只是一个雏形，但是我享受设计到组装完成的整个过程，我对他非常满意，也特别感谢我爸爸对他提出的各种建议，帮助我完成了这个作品。
Such a creative lamp is completed. I know it is just a prototype, but I enjoy the whole process from design to assembly. I am very satisfied with it, and I am especially grateful to my father for his various suggestions to help me complete this work.
